## Supervised Learning

What is supervised learning?

- Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where an input produces an output.
- Give the learning a dataset of the desired inputs and desired output labels and the learning algorithm eventually learns the write things to do.
- Eventually it will only need the input then it can determine the output.
- Regression is a type of supervised learning where as example trying to predict the price of a house from a chart of data. It is upto you to determine where the line on the chart should go.
